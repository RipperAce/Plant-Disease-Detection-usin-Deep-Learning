                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <p>Purple flecks or circular lesions which are brown in the centre and purple at margin; red flecks, purple lesions and/or brown black rings on fruit.</p>
                <h4>Cause</h4>
                <p>Fungus</p>
                <h4>Management</h4>
                <p>Remove dead wood, mummified fruit and cankers from trees to reduce spread of disease; burn any prunings that have been made from the tree; disease can be controlled by applying fungicides from silver tip to harvest.</p>

                <center><h3>Apple Scab</h3></center>
                <h4>Symptoms</h4>
                <p>Yellow or chlorotic spots on leaves; dark olive green spots on leaves and fruit; may be a velvety growth on spots on undersides of leaves; twisting of leaves; distorted leaves; severely infected leaves turn yellow and drop from tree.</p>
                <h4>Cause</h4>
                <p>Fungus</p>
                <h4>Management</h4>
                <p>Remove all leaves dropped from tree in the fall and compost to prevent any diseases surviving in debris; application of zinc and fertilizer grade urea in the Fall may be necessary to speed leaf drop, lime should then be added to fallen leaves; fungicide application may be necessary in areas where leaves remain wet for periods in excess of 9 hours; fungicides such as copper soaps and Bordeaux mixture should be applied if there is a chance of wet period as soon as leaf tips emerge.</p>

                <center><h3>Apple Cedar Rust</h3></center>

                <p>Bright orange or yellow patches on top side of leaves surrounded by a red band and small black spots in the center; by mid-summer, cup-like structures called aecia form on the leaf undersides; these become covered in tubular structures from which spores are released.</p>
                <h4>Cause</h4>
                <p>Fungus</p>
